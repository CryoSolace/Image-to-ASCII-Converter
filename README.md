# Image-to-ASCII-Converter
Title. Converts an image to ASCII (Select from three flavours!)

## Flavour 1: Black and White

The most basic and vanilla. Straight converts every pixel into black or white, whichever it is closer to. Then, convert black pixels into "#" and white pixels into "."

## Flavour 2: Greyscale

Nice, we got another bit for our colour depth! Let's celebrate by having four different greyscale colours for our picture.

## Flavour 3: Braille

The most time consuming out of the three to code, because half the time was spent creating the binary-to-braille dictionary while the other half was spent trying to format the stuff correctly. Whatever, it's done!
